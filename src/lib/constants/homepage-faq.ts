    question: "Why Next.js vs WordPress for med spas?",
    answer:
      "WordPress inherently slows down with every plugin and page you add. Your clinic needs dozens of specific treatment pages to rank properly. Next.js stays instantly fast at any scale, which directly increases your Google rankings and premium patient conversions.",

    question: "What if I already have a website?",

    question: "What makes your content better than hiring human writers?",
    answer:
      "Humans are too slow and expensive to generate the sheer volume of content required to dominate local search. Our AI pipeline produces 30+ medically reviewed, SEO-optimized articles every month. Human editors review every single piece before it goes live to guarantee quality and compliance.",
