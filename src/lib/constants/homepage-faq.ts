    question: "Why Next.js and not WordPress?",
    answer:
      "WordPress slows down with every plugin added. If you need 200 service pages to rank properly, that weight hurts your PageSpeed and rankings. Next.js stays fast at any scale. That speed affects your Google rankings, ad quality scores, and whether a visitor books or bounces in the first 3 seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Your site goes live in 3 to 5 weeks with every system active. SEO compounds over 60 to 90 days. Automation and lead capture work from day one. Most clients see ranking movement within 45 days and a clear increase in inbound leads by month 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "I already have a website. Do I need to rebuild?",
    answer:
      "Not always. We audit it first. If the setup is solid, we optimize and build on top. If it is holding you back, we say so and show exactly why a rebuild delivers better ROI. We never recommend a rebuild just to sell one.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your content better than hiring a writer?",
    answer:
      "A writer produces articles. We produce a content system. Every piece is mapped to a keyword, service, and location before a word is written. AI handles research and structure at speed. Humans refine tone and accuracy. The result compounds your rankings instead of filling a calendar.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need technical knowledge to work with you?",
    answer:
      "None. You run your business. We handle the build, launch, SEO, ads, content, automation, and reporting. Your dashboard is built to be understood in 30 seconds. On higher tiers, we walk through it together every month.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate with my existing CRM or booking system?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We work with most major platforms. In the audit phase we map your existing tools and build automation around them instead of forcing a migration. Disruption to your current operations is minimal by design.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is GEO and why does it matter now?",
    answer:
      "GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It is making your business visible inside AI search tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. These platforms are already changing how people find local businesses. Getting there now builds an advantage that latecomers cannot close quickly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    answer:
      "Local service businesses, health and wellness providers, professional services, and high-ticket operators who depend on appointments or inbound leads. If your business lives or dies by whether clients can find you online, we are built for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Kolavi worth it compared to a freelancer or cheaper agency?",
    answer:
      "A freelancer builds your site. We build the system around it. A cheaper agency charges less and delivers less. A complete Kolavi system includes your website, SEO, ads, content, automation, and reporting. Hiring those separately is significantly more expensive and performs worse because the parts do not connect. One system beats five separate vendors every time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to cancel?",
    answer:
      "No long-term lock-ins on standard tiers. We ask for 30 days notice so we can hand off everything cleanly. All assets, content, and systems we build are yours from day one.",
  },
