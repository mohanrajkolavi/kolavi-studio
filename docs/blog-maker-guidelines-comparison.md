# Blog Maker Guidelines: Google vs Rank Math

## Priority: Google First, Rank Math Second

| **Aspect** | **Google Search Central Guidelines** | **Rank Math Guidelines** | **How They Align** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Overall Philosophy** | People-first content. Write for humans first, search engines second. | "Your goal is to please the reader first and search engines second." | ✅ Aligned - Both prioritize readers |
| **Content Purpose** | Create content that genuinely helps readers. Satisfy search intent completely. | Score 100/100 in Rank Math tests | ⚠️ Aligned when quality maintained |
| **Expertise** | Demonstrate real expertise. Write from first-hand knowledge. Show E-E-A-T. | Not explicitly required | ✅ Google requirement takes priority |
| **Content Uniqueness** | Unique, original content. Don't copy or rehash competitors. | Not explicitly required | ✅ Google requirement takes priority |
| **Natural Language** | Keywords appear organically. No keyword stuffing (against spam policies). | Keyword density: 1-1.5% target, max 2.5% | ✅ Aligned - Both avoid stuffing |
| **Title** | Unique, clear, concise. Accurately describes contents. Avoid clickbait. | Primary keyword in first 50 chars. Max 60 chars. Keyword in first 50% of title. | ✅ Aligned when natural |
| **Meta Description** | Short, unique, includes relevant points. Compelling but honest. | Primary keyword in first 120-160 chars. Max 160 chars. End with CTA. | ✅ Aligned when honest |
| **URL Slug** | Not explicitly specified | Primary keyword in slug. Lowercase, hyphens. Max 75 chars. | ✅ Follow Rank Math (doesn't conflict) |
| **Keyword Placement** | Keywords appear naturally in content | Primary keyword in first 10% of content. All focus keywords in content. | ✅ Aligned when natural |
| **Keyword Density** | Natural language. No excessive repetition. | 1-1.5% target. Never exceed 2.5%. | ✅ Aligned - Both avoid stuffing |
| **Word Count** | Complete answers. Comprehensive information. | 2500+ words = 100% score. Min 1500 for pillar. | ⚠️ Google: Quality over quantity. Rank Math: Prefers 2500+ |
| **Subheadings** | Clear structure. Logical sections. Proper headings. | Primary + secondary keywords in H2/H3. | ✅ Aligned when natural |
| **Paragraphs** | Easy-to-read, well organized. | No paragraph >120 words. | ✅ Aligned - Both improve readability |
| **FAQ Section** | Helps users find answers (people-first). | Enables FAQ rich snippets. 3-5 Q&As for informational intent. | ✅ Aligned - Both benefit users |
| **Readability** | Easy-to-read. No spelling/grammar errors. | Short paragraphs. Clear structure. | ✅ Aligned |
| **Search Intent** | Satisfy search intent completely. Answer fully. | Not explicitly specified | ✅ Google requirement takes priority |
| **Content Structure** | Well organized. Logical flow. | Clear H2/H3 structure with keywords. | ✅ Aligned when natural |
| **Clickbait** | Avoid clickbait. Manage expectations. | Avoid clickbait per Google. | ✅ Aligned |
| **Images** | Not explicitly required for content quality | 4+ images for 100% score | ⚠️ Rank Math preference (added in WordPress) |

## Key Differences & Resolution

| **Conflict Area** | **Google Guideline** | **Rank Math Guideline** | **Resolution** |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Word Count** | Quality over quantity. Complete answers matter more than length. | 2500+ words preferred for 100% score | ✅ **Google wins**: If content naturally ends at 1800 words and fully answers query, that's better than padding to 2500 |
| **Keyword Placement** | Natural, organic appearance | Specific placement rules (first 10%, H2/H3) | ✅ **Aligned**: Apply Rank Math rules naturally, don't force |
| **Content Quality** | Real expertise, unique insights | Score optimization | ✅ **Google wins**: Never sacrifice quality for Rank Math scores |

## Implementation Priority

1. **PRIORITY 1: Google Guidelines** - Always follow
2. **PRIORITY 2: Rank Math Guidelines** - Follow only when they align with Google's people-first approach

## Decision Rule

> **If Rank Math requirements conflict with Google's people-first approach, prioritize Google. Natural, helpful content always wins.**

## Summary

- ✅ **Aligned**: Most Rank Math guidelines align with Google when applied naturally
- ⚠️ **Conditional**: Some Rank Math preferences (word count, images) are secondary to content quality
- ✅ **Priority**: Google guidelines always take precedence in conflicts
