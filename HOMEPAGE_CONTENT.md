## 2. Services (ServicesSection) — id: `services`

**Label:** What We Build

**Heading**
- Six systems.
- One goal: more revenue.

**Intro**
- Every piece connects. SEO brings the traffic. The website converts it. Automation captures it. Content compounds it. Month after month, the system builds on itself.

**Services (6 cards)**

1. **Performance Websites**  
   Badge: 95+ PageSpeed  
   Hook: Built to load fast, rank high, and convert. Before the competition does.  
   Body: Custom Next.js from a blank canvas. No WordPress. No templates. No page builders. Your site hits 95+ PageSpeed on launch day. That speed improves your Google rankings, lowers your ad costs, and keeps visitors long enough to become clients.

2. **AI-Powered SEO**  
   Badge: Market Capture  
   Hook: Own every search in your market before your competitors know what happened.  
   Body: On-page optimization. Technical audits. Citations across 50+ directories. High-authority backlinks every month. Programmatic pages targeting every city and service combination at scale. This is not SEO maintenance. This is market capture.

3. **Lead Gen and Automation**  
   Badge: 24/7 Pipeline  
   Hook: Leads come in at 3am. The system follows up before you wake up.  
   Body: AI chatbots. CRM integration. Multi-step funnels. Booking confirmations, reminders, post-visit sequences, all running without you. No lead goes cold. No opportunity disappears in an inbox. The pipeline works around the clock.

4. **Content Engine**  
   Badge: 30 Posts/Month  
   Hook: 30 posts a month. Every one targeting a keyword that closes deals.  
   Body: AI-assisted and human-edited. Every piece maps to a specific keyword, service, or location before a word gets written. Not filler to hit a quota. Compound traffic that grows month over month without touching your ad budget.

5. **Reputation and Reporting**  
   Badge: Full Visibility  
   Hook: Every lead traced back to the campaign that created it. No guessing. Ever.  
   Body: Automated review requests after every client visit. Call tracking tied directly to campaigns. A real-time dashboard showing exactly what drove each lead. No monthly reports full of metrics that mean nothing. Just the numbers that matter.

6. **GEO — AI Search Visibility**  
   Badge: Future Ready  
   Hook: Your clients are already searching on ChatGPT. Are you showing up?  
   Body: Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity — search is changing fast. Most agencies have never heard of Generative Engine Optimization. We build it into every site from day one. Show up where your competitors are completely invisible.

## 3. Testimonials / Proof (TestimonialsSection) — id: `testimonials`

**Label:** Proven Methodology

**Heading**
- This is not theory.
- We built it on our own platform first.

**Body**
- Before the first client, the founder built Business Mavericks from zero. 31,000 monthly organic visitors. 60,000 Instagram followers. Not through ad spend. Not through connections. Through a content and SEO system built with obsessive, systematic precision.
- The same brands that spend millions on advertising paid to be featured in that content.
- They do not sponsor low-traffic websites.

**Follow-up**
- That is the same system we now deploy for every client. The methodology is proven. The results are public. The difference is we are now doing it for your business, not ours.

**Sponsor proof cards (3)**
1. **Groww, Paytm** — India's largest fintech platforms — Paid sponsorships secured through organic content ranked on page 1.
2. **Amazon, PayPal** — Global e-commerce and payments — Featured partnerships driven entirely by SEO-built traffic. No outbound pitching.
3. **Citibank** — Global banking — When Citibank pays to appear in your content, the traffic is real.

**Founder stats (3)**
- **31K** — Monthly organic visitors — Built from zero. No paid traffic. No shortcuts.
- **60K+** — Organic followers — Content strategy only. Zero paid promotion.

**Label:** The Process

**Heading**
- Simple on your end.
- Engineered on ours.

**Intro**
- Four steps. No surprises. No waiting around. From first audit to a system that runs itself.

**Steps (4 cards)**

1. **01 — Audit and Strategy**  
   Timeline: Days 1 to 14  
   Description: We go through your digital presence without sugarcoating it. Site speed. SEO gaps. Competitor positioning. Conversion bottlenecks. You get a complete growth roadmap before we write a single line of code.  
   Supporting: No recycled playbooks. A strategy built around your business, your market, your revenue goals.

2. **02 — Build and Engineer**  
   Timeline: Days 14 to 28  
   Description: Your Next.js site gets built from scratch. Custom design. Schema markup. Core Web Vitals dialed in. At the same time, your SEO infrastructure goes up. Google Business Profile, citations, programmatic pages, content pipeline.  
   Supporting: Most agencies build the site, then figure out SEO. We run both tracks simultaneously so you launch with momentum.

3. **03 — Launch and Activate**  
   Timeline: Days 28 to 35  
   Description: Site goes live with every tracking pixel in place. Automation sequences fire. Review requests activate. AI chatbot goes online. The system starts generating leads before your first monthly report lands.  
   Supporting: Not a placeholder dashboard. Actual data, actual tracking, actual leads. From day one.

4. **04 — Scale and Compound**  
   Timeline: Ongoing  
   Description: Monthly content stacks rankings. Programmatic pages capture long-tail searches across every service and location. Backlink campaigns grow authority. CRO testing converts more from the same traffic.  
   Supporting: Every month your lead volume grows. Not because we spend more. Because the system was designed to compound from the start.

**Process stats**
- 3 to 5 weeks — Average time to launch
- Day 1 — Dashboard goes live
- 45 days — First ranking movement
- Month 3 — Compounding kicks in

## 6. Why Choose Us (WhyChooseUsSection) — id: `why-choose-us`

**Label:** Why Kolavi

**Heading**
- Built for 2026.
- Not 2012.

**Intro**
- Most agencies built their systems over a decade ago. They updated their website. They did not update their process. We built ours from scratch in 2026, AI-native from the first line of code. That is not a marketing claim. It shows in the results.

**Differentiators (4)**

1. **Speed is a revenue variable, not a technical footnote**  
   A one-second delay drops conversions by 7 percent. Every site we ship loads in under one second on launch day. Your competitors are running 22-plugin WordPress installs sitting at PageSpeed 54. You will not be. That gap compounds over every visitor, every day.  
   Proof: 95+ PageSpeed, every launch, no exceptions.

2. **We do in days what takes other agencies months**  
   AI-powered workflows let us ship 30 SEO posts a month, build 200 programmatic pages, and run automated nurture sequences around the clock. The output scales. Your retainer does not have to.  
   Proof: 10x faster delivery than traditional agencies.

3. **We report in revenue, not impressions**  
   Every dashboard we build connects campaign activity to actual booked clients. Call tracking. Conversion attribution. Revenue by source. If we cannot trace a dollar from campaign to client, we fix the tracking before the next report. No vanity metrics. No smoke.  
   Proof: Every client gets a live revenue dashboard from day one.

4. **Your clients are searching on ChatGPT. We make sure they find you.**  
   Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity are already changing how people discover local businesses. Most agencies have never heard of Generative Engine Optimization. We have been building it into every site from day one. Your competitors are invisible there. You will not be.  
   Proof: Your competitors are not there yet. You will be.

**Stats (4)**
- 95+ — PageSpeed on every launch
- 31K — Organic visitors built from zero
- 0 — Templates ever used
- 10x — Faster delivery than traditional agencies

## 7. Who We Are (WhoWeAreSection) — id: `about`

**Label:** About Kolavi

**Heading**
- Built different from day one.

**Body**
- Most agencies were built to manage clients, not grow them. They sell strategy decks. They deliver reports. We asked what an agency would look like if it were built today, from scratch, with results as the only metric that matters.
- Before Kolavi, our founder built Business Mavericks to 31,000 monthly organic visitors and 60,000 Instagram followers. Not through ad spend. Through a content and SEO system executed with obsessive, systematic precision over years. Groww, Paytm, Amazon, PayPal, and Citibank paid to be featured in that content. That is not luck. That is a system that works.
- That same system is what we build for every client. Not a version of it. The exact methodology. Applied to your market, your services, your revenue goals.
- We are not trying to be the biggest agency. We are building the one that businesses actually trust. Because every deliverable gets the same focus most agencies save for their own pitch decks.

**Quote**
- "We built Kolavi because we were tired of watching good businesses get mediocre results from agencies that were coasting. Every client gets the same system we used to build our own."
- — Mohanraj, Founder, Kolavi Studio

**Proof cards (3)**
- **31K** — Monthly organic visitors — Built from zero. No paid traffic. A content system that compounded month over month.
- **60K+** — Organic followers — Through content strategy alone. Zero paid promotion. Across platforms.
- **5** — Content sponsors — Groww, Paytm, Amazon, PayPal, Citibank.

## 8. FAQ (FAQsSection)

**Label:** FAQ

**Heading**
- Questions worth asking.

**Subtext**
- Not finding what you need? Book a free audit call. We answer everything before you commit to anything.

**FAQ items (10 — from `homepage-faq.ts`)**

1. **Why Next.js and not WordPress?**  
   WordPress slows down with every plugin added. If you need 200 service pages to rank properly, that weight hurts your PageSpeed and rankings. Next.js stays fast at any scale. That speed affects your Google rankings, ad quality scores, and whether a visitor books or bounces in the first 3 seconds.

2. **How fast will I see results?**  
   Your site goes live in 3 to 5 weeks with every system active. SEO compounds over 60 to 90 days. Automation and lead capture work from day one. Most clients see ranking movement within 45 days and a clear increase in inbound leads by month 3.

3. **I already have a website. Do I need to rebuild?**  
   Not always. We audit it first. If the setup is solid, we optimize and build on top. If it is holding you back, we say so and show exactly why a rebuild delivers better ROI. We never recommend a rebuild just to sell one.

4. **What makes your content better than hiring a writer?**  
   A writer produces articles. We produce a content system. Every piece is mapped to a keyword, service, and location before a word is written. AI handles research and structure at speed. Humans refine tone and accuracy. The result compounds your rankings instead of filling a calendar.

5. **Do I need technical knowledge to work with you?**  
   None. You run your business. We handle the build, launch, SEO, ads, content, automation, and reporting. Your dashboard is built to be understood in 30 seconds. On higher tiers, we walk through it together every month.

6. **Can you integrate with my existing CRM or booking system?**  
   Yes. We work with most major platforms. In the audit phase we map your existing tools and build automation around them instead of forcing a migration. Disruption to your current operations is minimal by design.

7. **What is GEO and why does it matter now?**  
   GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It is making your business visible inside AI search tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. These platforms are already changing how people find local businesses. Getting there now builds an advantage that latecomers cannot close quickly.

8. **What types of businesses do you work with?**  
   Local service businesses, health and wellness providers, professional services, and high-ticket operators who depend on appointments or inbound leads. If your business lives or dies by whether clients can find you online, we are built for you.

9. **Is Kolavi worth it compared to a freelancer or cheaper agency?**  
   A freelancer builds your site. We build the system around it. A cheaper agency charges less and delivers less. A complete Kolavi system includes your website, SEO, ads, content, automation, and reporting. Hiring those separately is significantly more expensive and performs worse because the parts do not connect. One system beats five separate vendors every time.

10. **What if I want to cancel?**  
    No long-term lock-ins on standard tiers. We ask for 30 days notice so we can hand off everything cleanly. All assets, content, and systems we build are yours from day one.
